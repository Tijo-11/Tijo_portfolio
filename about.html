        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Tijo, and welcome to my portfolio. I’m an aspiring web developer 
            currently undergoing rigorous training at Brototype.</p>
        <p>I learn from industry experts through various platforms such as YouTube videos, 
            blogs, and websites. My goal is to create dynamic, user-friendly websites that 
            provide engaging digital experiences, helping businesses connect with their 
            audience.</p>
        <p>My journey into web development began with a deep interest in coding, 
            and it’s a journey I continue to pursue, constantly learning and growing 
            in the tech field.</p>
        <!-- Objective Section -->
        <h3>My Objective</h3>
        <p>To contribute meaningfully to society by embracing knowledge, 
            creativity, and empathy. I aim to create impactful digital experiences, 
            promote awareness around mental health, and foster a world driven by science, 
            rationality, and cultural understanding. Through continuous learning and personal 
            growth, I strive to inspire others while staying 
            committed to making a positive difference in the lives I touch. <br>
            My immediate goal is to be a web developer and develop applications and 
            websites that deliver value 
            to users while maintaining simplicity and usability. I aim to enhance my skills 
            further and take on larger, more challenging projects in the future.</p>
        <!-- Add more sections as needed for your background, experience, etc. -->
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>With an undergraduate background in Physics, Mathematics, and Electronics, 
            I pursued a master's in Physics driven by my curiosity about the 
            underlying secrets of the universe. However, I found myself dissatisfied
             with the current research landscape. To support myself, I shifted to 
             preparing students for IIT-JEE and NEET entrance exams. 
            As a Physics teacher, I performed well, with students from my 
            first batch securing admissions in prestigious institutions such as 
            IIT Madras, NIT Trichy, and IIIT Odisha.</p>
        <p>I differentiated myself as a teacher by focusing not only on academic success 
            but also on the holistic development of my students. I understood their 
            challenges in learning and suggested better methodologies and more efficient
             ways to approach problems.
             Despite the joy I found in my students' achievements, 
        I felt dissatisfied with the repetitive nature of my academic career.</p>
        <p>At this point, the field of coding intrigued me. Learning that Sir 
            Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web and the 
            HTML language, was also a physicist, served as a powerful motivation. 
            The principles behind computing, rooted in semiconductor physics, 
            resonated with my scientific background. This year, the Nobel Prize in 
            Physics was awarded for work applying physics principles to Artificial 
            Intelligence, which further strengthened my belief that my foundation in 
            Physics could be applied to the coding world. This connection sparked my 
            decision to venture into coding, 
            and I am now fully committed to giving it my best try.</p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I have a deep passion for reading, with a love for both fiction 
            and non-fiction. Some of my favorite books include 100 Years of 
            Solitude, The Alchemist, and Angels and Demons. Among authors, 
            Basheer holds a special place in my heart for his timeless storytelling. 
            Beyond books, I am a movie enthusiast who enjoys exploring films in Malayalam, 
            Hollywood, Tamil, 
            and Hindi. Movies are a source of inspiration and entertainment for me.</p>
        <p>Music is another passion of mine, and I enjoy a wide variety of genres, 
            including pop-rock, EDM, rap, and melodies in Malayalam, Tamil, and Hindi. 
            My favorite music director is Vidyasagar, and I admire singers like Sujatha, 
            Shreya Ghoshal, P. Jayachandran, M.G. Sreekumar, Ellie Goulding, Taylor Swift, 
            and Justin Bieber. I’m also a fan of bands such as Imagine Dragons, Coldplay, 
            Linkin Park, and Twenty One Pilots, 
            whose music continues to inspire me.</p>
        <p>I also love traveling and meeting people, immersing myself in new 
            cultures and experiences. My bucket list includes many places I hope to 
            explore someday. Additionally, I am a passionate mental health promoter, 
            committed to eradicating societal stigmas around mental disorders.</p>
            <p>As a rationalist, I believe in the power of science and evidence-based thinking. 
                I am convinced that 
                making decisions rooted in facts and logic is the path to a better, 
                brighter future.</p>
